    This application was built in terms of a bachelor thesis in Media
    Systems of the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences from Carsten
    Clauss in 2021. The Thesis is about a comparison of the Javascript
    Frameworks Angular, React and Vue. For the comparison I built three
    same-looking Applications with the help of each Framework.
